# Un-official implementation of HSIC Bottleneck 

### From the paper - "The HSIC Bottleneck: Deep Learning without Back-Propagation"
The code is inspired from the original code repo: https://github.com/choasma/HSIC-bottleneck.
HSIC-bottleneck objective function is defined according to Equation 3 of the paper.
